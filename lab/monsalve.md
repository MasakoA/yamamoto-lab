research_interests: "Glucocorticoids (GCs) are lipophilic hormones that regulate a range of essential physiologic processes in vertebrates. GCs bind to and activate the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), which modulates transcription of cell-specific target genes in virtually all cell types. The intracellular concentrations of GCs modulate the activity of GR, but mechanisms that affect hormone entry into cells have not been thoroughly investigated. To identify the factors underlying the mediated transport of GCs, I am using a combination of biochemistry, genetic and chemical screens in mammalian and nematode model systems. This work will define novel molecular pathways of steroid transport and establish a new layer of metazoan gene regulation.",
