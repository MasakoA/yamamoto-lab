research_interests: "Animals precisely control when and where genes are expressed; failure to do so can cause severe developmental defects and pathology. Transcription factors (TFs) must display extraordinary functional flexibility, controlling very different sets of genes in different cell and tissue types. To do so, they integrate information from signaling pathways, chromatin, and cofactors to ensure that the correct ensemble of genes is orchestrated in any given context. The number of regulatory inputs, and the complex physiology and large number of cell and tissue types in most experimentally tractable metazoans has rendered this combinatorial regulation of transcription nearly impenetrable. The compact genome, invariant development, simple tissues, and tools to track gene expression temporally and spatially make C. elegans an ideal model to study combinatorial transcriptional regulation in a developmental context. I am approaching this problem by exploring three distinct, yet related questions: i) how does a single input (sumoylation) regulate a single TF in different tissues and different points during development; ii) how do two TFs cooperate to integrate multiple inputs to control an essential, yet largely unexplored, developmental gene regulatory network (molting); iii) how has evolution shaped the molting gene regulatory network in a related nematode, the human parasite, B. malayi?  Together these aims will dissect how complex regulatory inputs are integrated into gene regulatory networks temporally and spatially during development and how selective pressure during evolution shapes these networks.

My work using C. elegans to study parasitic nematode molting has been funded by a recently awarded K99 grant from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences. Writing a K99 was a challenging, ultimately rewarding experience. I have shared my K99 advice on the strategic planning that I undertook before writing the grant, as well as a list of resources that I found particularly helpful, in an article that I posted on my website: http://www.jordandward.com/k99-grant-writing.html",
