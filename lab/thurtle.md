Transcriptional Regulatory Factors bind to regulatory elements to finely tune the expression of the appropriate target gene. Regulating only the appropriate target gene is integral to the fidelity of the cellâ€™s transcriptional regulatory network, yet how a transcriptional regulatory factor regulates only the appropriate target gene is not well understood. I aim to identify the boundary effectors that ensure correct transcriptional regulation of the target gene and prevent aberrant regulation of neighboring genes by transcriptional regulatory factors. I am performing genetic screens in C. elegans, exploiting the compact genome of the worm,to discover boundary effectors that insulate the Nuclear Hormone Receptor, NHR-25.
